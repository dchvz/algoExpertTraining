# Linked Lists
### Singly linked list

Consists of nodes, with values and a pointer to the next node in the list.

The first node in a list is referred to as the head of the linked list, the last node is called the tail of the linked list

Visual representation:

1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> null

#### Operations on the list
- Accessing the head O(1)
- Accessing the tail O(n)
- Inserting/removing the head O(1)
- Inserting or removing the tail O(n) to access + O(n)
- Searching for a value O(n)

### Double linked list

each node has also a pointer to the previous node

null <-> 1 <-> 2 <-> 3 <-> 4 <-> 5 <-> null

#### Operations on the list
- Accessing the head O(1)
- Accessing the tail O(n)
- Inserting/removing the head O(1)
- Inserting or removing the tail O(1)
- Searching for a value O(n)
