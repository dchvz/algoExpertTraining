# Monotonic Array ðŸ”µ
# Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns a boolean
# representing whether the array is monotonic.
# An array is said to be monotonic if its elements, from left to right,
# are entirely non-increasing or entirely non-decreasing.
# Non-increasing elements aren't necessarily exclusively decreasing;
# they simply don't increase. Similarly, non-decreasing elements aren't
# necessarily exclusively increasing; they simply don't decrease.
# Sample Input
# array = [-1, -5, -10, -1100, -1100, -1101, -1102, -9001]
# Sample Output
# true

# [-1, -5 , -10, -10, -11]
# since -5 <= -1, should be non-increasing!
# -10 <= -5, good
# -10 <= 10, good
# -11 <= 10, good
# in a different case:
# [-1, -5 , -10, -10, -11,1]
# 1 <= -11, no, so return False

# [1,4,6,8]
# 1 and 4
# 4 >= 1, so should be non-decreasing!
# 6 >= 4, yes, good
# 8 >= 6, yes, good

# Time Complexity O(n)
# Space Complexity O(1)
