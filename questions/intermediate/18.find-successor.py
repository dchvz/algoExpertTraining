# ðŸŸ¦ Find Successor
# Write a function that takes in a Binary Tree and a node contained in that tree and returns the given node's successor.
# A node's successor is the next node to be visited (immediately after the given node) when traversing its tree using the in-order tree-traversal technique.
# Each BinaryTree node has an integer value, a left child node, a right child node, and a parent node.
# If a node has no successor, your function should return None / null.
# A node is said to be a valid BinaryTree node if and only if it satisfies the BinaryTree property where its children nodes are either valid BinaryTree nodes themselves or None / null.
# Sample Input
# tree =    1
#           / \
#          2   3
#         / \ / \
#        4  5 6  7
#       / \
#      8  9
# node = 5
# Sample Output
# 6

# This is an input class. Do not edit.
