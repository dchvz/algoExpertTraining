# ðŸŸ¦ Reconstruct BST
# The pre-order traversal of a binary search tree (BST) is given as an array of integers. Write a function that reconstructs the tree represented by this pre-order traversal array. The function should return the root of the reconstructed BST.
# You can assume that there will be no duplicate values in the BST.
# Each BST node has an integer value, a left child node, and a right child node. A node is said to be a valid BST node if and only if it satisfies the BST property where its value is strictly greater than the values of every node to its left; its value is less than or equal to the values of every node to its right; and its children nodes are either valid BST nodes themselves or None / null.
# Sample Input
# preOrderTraversalValues = [10, 4, 2, 1, 5, 17, 19, 18]
# Sample Output
#         10
#        /  \
#       4    17
#      / \     \
#     2   5     19
#    /         /
#   1         18

# 10,4,2,1,5,17,19,18
# add 10
# all elements to the left are 4,2,1,5
# all elements to the right are 17, 19 ,18
# assign to the left [4,2,1,5]
# assign 4 to the left
# all elements to the left [2,1]
# all elements to the right [5]
# assign 2 to the left
# all elements to the left [1]
# assign 1 to the left
# no elements to the left/right, return root which is 1 at this point
# when 2 is assigned, no elements to the right, return root which is 2 at this point
# when 4 is assigned...
# assign 5 to the right
# no elements to the left or right, return root which is 5 at that point
# when 10 is assigned...
# [17,19,18]
# assign 17 to the right
# elements to the left []
# elements to the right [18,19]
# assign 18 to the right
# elements to the left []
# elements to the right
# assign 19 to the right
# no elements ot the left or right, return root which is 19 at this point
# recursion is done
