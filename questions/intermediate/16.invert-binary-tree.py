# ðŸŸ¦ Invert Binary Tree
# Write a function that takes in a binary tree and inverts it. In other words,
# the function should swap every left node in the tree for its corresponding right node.
# Each BinaryTree node has an integer value, a left child node, and a right child node.
# A node is said to be a valid BinaryTree node if and only if it satisfies the BinaryTree property where its children nodes are either valid BinaryTree nodes themselves or None / null.
# Sample Input
# tree =    1
#           / \
#          2   3
#         / \ / \
#        4  5 6  7
#
# Sample Output
# tree =    1
#           / \
#          3   2
#         / \ / \
#        7  6 5  4
