# Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of integers and returns an array of the products
# of all the integers in the input array except for the integer at that index.
# note, we cannot use division to solve this problem.
# For example, if our input array is [5, 1, 4, 2], our expected output would be [8, 40, 10, 20]
# because:  1 * 4 * 2 = 8, 5 * 4 * 2 = 40, 5 * 1 * 2 = 10, 5 * 1 * 4 = 20

# Time Complexity O(n)
# Space Complexity O(n)
