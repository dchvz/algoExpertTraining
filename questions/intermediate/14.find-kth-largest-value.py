# ðŸŸ¦ Find Kth Largest Value
# Write a function that takes in a Binary Search Tree (BST) and a positive integer k and returns the kth largest value in the BST. You can assume that there will only be integer values in the BST and that k is less than or equal to the number of nodes in the tree.
# Each BST node has an integer value, a left child node, and a right child node. A node is said to be a valid BST node if and only if it satisfies the BST property where its value is strictly greater than the values of every node to its left; its value is less than or equal to the values of every node to its right; and its children nodes are either valid BST nodes themselves or None / null.
# Sample Input
# tree =    15
#           /  \
#          10   20
#         / \   / \
#        8  12 17 25
#       / \
#      6   9
# k = 3
# Sample Output
# 17 // The 3rd largest value in the BST is 17.

# This is an input class. Do not edit.
