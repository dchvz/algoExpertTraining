# Longest Peak ğŸ”µ
# Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns the length of the longest peak in the array.
# A peak is defined as adjacent integers in the array that are strictly increasing until they reach a
# tip (the highest value in the peak), at which point they become strictly decreasing.
# At least three integers are required to form a peak.
# For example, the integers 1, 4, 10, 2 form a peak, but the integers 4, 0, 10 don't and neither do the integers 1, 2, 3.
# To solve this problem, we can iterate through the array and keep track of the longest peak we find.
# Sample Input
# array = [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 0, 10, 6, 5, -1, -3, 2, 1, 0]
# Sample Output
# 6 // 0, 10, 6, 5, -1, -3
