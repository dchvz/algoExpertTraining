# Validate BST ðŸ”µ
# Write a function that takes in a potentially invalid Binary Search Tree (BST) and returns a boolean
# representing whether the BST is valid.
# A valid BST is defined as a binary tree in which for every node, its value is strictly greater than the values of every node to its left;
# its value is less than or equal to the values of every node to its right;
# and its children nodes are either valid BSTs themselves or None / null.
# Sample Input
# tree =    10
#         /    \
#        5      15
#      /  \    /  \
#     2    5  13   22
#   /  \
#  1    3
# Sample Output
# true

# This is an input class. Do not edit.

def validationHelper(tree, minValue, maxValue):

  if tree is None:
    return True

  # we know that every element to the left has to be strictly less than the current tree value
  # we know that every element to the right has to be strictly equal or larger than current tree value
  # if any of those conditions break, it is not a BST
