# Node Depths ðŸŸ¢
# The distance between a node in a Binary tree and the tree's root node is called the node's depth.
# Write a function that takes a Binary Tree and returns the sum of its nodes' depths.
# Each BinaryTree node has a `value` property, a `left` property pointing to the left child node, and a `right` property pointing to the right child node. The root node's depth is 0.

# Sample Input
# tree =
#         1
#        / \
#       2   3
#      / \
#     4   8
#    / \
#   5   6
## Sample Output: 8
## Explanation: The depths of the nodes are as follows:
# - Node 1 (root): depth 0
# - Node 2: depth 1
# - Node 3: depth 1
# - Node 4: depth 2
# - Node 8: depth 2
# - Node 5: depth 3
# - Node 6: depth 3
