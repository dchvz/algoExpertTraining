# Bubble Sort ðŸŸ¢
# Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns a sorted version of that array using the Bubble Sort algorithm
# The bubble sort consists of swapping each value with the next value if they are in the wrong order
# Repeat that process for as long as there are swaps being made

# Time Complexity O(n) at best if already sorted, O(nÂ²) in the worst case, meaning swapping all the elements or looping all of them multiple times
# Space Complexity O(1)
