# Run-Length Encoding ðŸŸ¢
# Write a function that takes in a string and returns its run-length encoding
# From Wikipedia, "run-length encoding is a form of lossless data compression in which runs of data are stored as a single data value and count, rather than as the original run"
# For this problem, a run of data is any sequence of consecutive, identical characters. So the string "AAA" would be run-length encoded as "3A" (three A's)
# To make things more complicated, however, the input string can contain all sorts of special characters, including numbers
# And since encoded data must be decodable, this means that we can't have runs of more than 9 characters. In other words, the run-length encoding "12A" would be invalid
# For the input string "AAAAAAAAAAAA" (12 A's), the correct encoding would be "9A3A" (nine A's followed by three A's)
# Sample Input: "AAAAAAAAAAAAABBCCCCDD"
# Sample Output: "9A4A2B4C2D"

# Time Complexity O(n) where n is the characters in the array
# Space Complexity O(n) where n is the length of the input string
