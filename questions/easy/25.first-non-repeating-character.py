# First Non-Repeating Character ðŸŸ¢
# Write a function that takes in a string of lowercase English-alphabet letters and returns the index of the string's first non-repeating character.
# The first non-repeating character is the first character in a string that occurs only once.
# If a string doesn't have any non-repeating characters, your function should return -1.
# Sample Input: "abcdcaf"
# Sample Output: 1 (The first non-repeating character is "b" and is found at index 1)

# Time Complexity O(n) where n is the length of the string
# Space Complexity O(1) because the English alphabet contains 26 characters
