# Optimal Freelancing ğŸŸ¢
# You recently decided to start freelancing. You have a list of jobs that you could do, where each job has a payment amount and a deadline.
# Each job takes one full day to complete, and you can only work on a single job each day.
# Given a list of jobs, write a function that returns the maximum amount of money you can earn by the end of the week if you only work for 7 days and you can only work on a job before its deadline.
# Each job is represented as an object with a "payment" integer property and a "deadline" integer property.
# The "payment" property represents how much money you will earn upon completing the job, and the "deadline" property represents the last day you can work on the job.
## Each job will take one day to complete, and you can only work on a single job each day.

# Sample Input:
# [
#   { "payment": 1, "deadline": 1 },
#   { "payment": 2, "deadline": 1 },
#   { "payment": 2, "deadline": 2 },
# ]
# Sample Output: 3

# This solution is ideal because it takes the most profitable as close to the deadline as possible
# Time Complexity O(n), where n is the number of jobs, actually is O(d * n) where d is the number of days to work (7 in this case) but since it's a constant we can ignore it
# Space Complexity O(1)
