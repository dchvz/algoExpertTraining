# Class Photos ðŸŸ¢
# Given two lists of heights, one for students wearing red shirts and one for students wearing blue shirts,
# determine if it's possible to arrange the students in two rows such that all students in the back row are taller
# than those in the front row.

# Sample Input: red_shirt_heights = [5, 6, 7], blue_shirt_heights = [4, 5, 6]
# Sample Output: True

# Time Complexity O(nlogn) because we need to short the input array
# Space Complexity O(1) since we do not use additional data structures
