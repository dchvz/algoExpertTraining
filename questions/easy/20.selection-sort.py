# Selection Sort ðŸŸ¢
# Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns a sorted version of that array using the Selection Sort algorithm
# The selection sort algorithm works by iterating through the array and finding the smallest number in the array
# Then swapping that number with the number in the first position
# Then it continues iterating through the array starting at the second position, finding the smallest number
# and swapping it with the number in the second position
# It continues doing this until it reaches the end of the array

# Time Complexity O(nÂ²) where n is the numbers in the array
# Space Complexity is O(1) because the sort happens in place
