# Find Three Largest Numbers ğŸŸ¢
# Write a function that takes in an array of at least three integers and without sorting the input array,
# returns a sorted array of the three largest integers in the input array
# Sample Input: [141, 1, 17, -7, -17, -27, 18, 541, 8, 7]
# Sample Output: [141, 541, 18]

# Time Complexity O(n)
# Space Complexity O(1) since we do not use auxiliary data structures
