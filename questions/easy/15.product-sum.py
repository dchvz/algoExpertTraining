# Product Sum ðŸŸ¢
# Write a function that takes in a special array and returns its product sum
# A special array is the sum of its elements where special arrays inside it are summed themselves, and then multiplied by their depth
# The product sum of [x+y] is x+y; the product sum of [x, [y, z]] is x + 2 * (y + z); the product sum of [x, [y, [z]]] is x + 2 * (y + 3 * z)
# Sample Input: [5,2,[7,-1],3,[6,[-13,8],4]]
# Sample Output: 12

  return get_inner_array_sum(array, 1, 1)

# Time Complexity O(n) where n is all the elements and sum elements
# Space Complexity O(d) where d is the maximum depth of the nested arrays
# Note: The space complexity is due to the recursive calls
