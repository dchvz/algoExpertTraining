## The objective of this repo

Document my learning through the use of the AlgoExpert Platform for future reference

I will only thrive to do the first 100 questions of Algo Expert, the remaining 'Very Hard' questions will probably have to wait a bit more :) or who knows I might give it a shot when I am done with the first hundred

### Current Progress
